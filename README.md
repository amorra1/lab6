<h1>Priority Queues and Heaps</h1>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
The problem included modifying existing code to accomodate new functional requirements. In this case it was required to turn a binary heap into a ternary heap. This means that each node has up 3 children instead of 2. This problem was designed to be a simulation of a real-world task that a software engineer may be asked to do.
